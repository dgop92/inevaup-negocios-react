# Inevaup negocios

A react web app for managing a small retail tech businnes.

The project was an assignment from the class "OOP" of my university

Features:

* Brands and Catalogues
* Products
* Providers
* Entries and Purchases
* Exits and Sales
* Generate invoices

## Project setup

This project is just the client, you also need to set up the server.
Instructions here: [retail-tech-business-api](https://github.com/dgop92/retail-tech-business-api)

Remember to create a .env file

### Download the dependencies with npm

```
npm install
```

### Run the app in localhost

```
npm run
```

## Notes:

Due to this was an assignment, the development process sped up making 
the code messy on some occasions. Another reason is because this is 
one of the first projects that I built with React
