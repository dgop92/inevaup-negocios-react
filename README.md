# Inevaup negocios

A react web app for managing a small retail tech businnes.

The project was an assignment from the class "OOP" of my university

Features:

- Brands and Catalogues

- Generate invoices

## Preview

You can see a simplified preview of the app here: [Inevaup Negocios](https://inevaup-negocios.netlify.app/login)

The API is hosted on the free plan of Heroku, so you will have to wait until the container wake up

## Project setup

This project is just the client, you also need to set up the server.
Instructions here: [retail-tech-business-api](https://github.com/dgop92/retail-tech-business-api)

Remember to create a .env file

### Download the dependencies with npm

```
npm install
```

### Run the app in localhost

```
npm start
```

## Notes:

Due to this was an assignment, the development process sped up making
the code messy on some occasions. Another reason is because this is
one of the first projects that I built with React
