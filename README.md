## Project setup

This project is just the client, you also need to set up the server.
Instructions here: [retail-tech-business-api](https://github.com/dgop92/retail-tech-business-api)

Remember to create a .env file

### Download the dependencies with npm

## Notes:

Due to this was an assignment and one of the first projects that I built with React, the development process sped up making the code messy on some occasions, and the overall experience is not perfect.
